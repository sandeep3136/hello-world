Initially, the motto of elixir is to educate less facilitated students who lack knowledge in technical advancements that are rapidly taking place in the pace of globalisation.

Presently, Elixir comprises different sections like Start-up Stories, which is an interview with renowned Start-ups, Career Post authored by professionals, Entrepreneur Stories, Tech Articles, Literature, Articles on Social Issues, Photography and Art Corner. Today, Elixir stands as one of the best platforms for an engineering student to explore his/her writing skills. Moreover Elixir is first of itâ€™s kind i.e. a non-commercial student eMagazine.
